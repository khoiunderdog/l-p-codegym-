        <p > <span>04/09/08:Spatulas</span> 
            Yesterday I went to the store and got some much needes spatulas!(What better way to say i love myself than to buy myself a spatula?</p>

        <p> <span>04/08/08: Cookie Monster Cupcakes</span> 
            My favourite cartoon character is Cookie Monster,and my favourite desert is cupcakes,so cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of the worlds. 
            Did you know ? Cookie Monster once said :"Sometimes me think what is love and then me think love is what last cookie is for>me give up the last cookie for you."I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes?(If so,i dont think I can ever love ANYONE!
